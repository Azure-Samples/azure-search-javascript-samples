# Azure Cognitive Search JavaScript Samples repository

This repository contains JavaScript sample code used in Azure Cognitive Search quickstarts, tutorials, and examples.

## Quickstart

This Node.js console app uses the Azure Cognitive Search REST APIs to create an index, load it with documents, and execute a few queries. The index is modeled on a subset of the Hotels dataset, reduced for readability and comprehension. Index definition and documents are included in the code.
