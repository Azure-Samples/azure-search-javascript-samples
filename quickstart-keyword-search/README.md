# Quickstart: Keyword search in Azure AI Search using JavaScript

![Quickstart sample MIT license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This sample demonstrates the fundamentals of creating, loading, and querying a search index for full-text search, also known as keyword search. The index is modeled on a subset of the hotels dataset, which has been reduced for readability and comprehension.

| `hotels_quickstart_index.json` | Index schema definition |
| `hotels.json` | Sample hotel documents |
| `sample.env` | Environment variable template for configuration |
